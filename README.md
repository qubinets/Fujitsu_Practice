# Fujitsu_Practice
Java Programming Exercise
This Java Programming Exercise was given me by Fujitsu to check my REST API skills,which i dont really have=). all code made here is my first attempt in REST.
This is Back-end project.
Making API i was assuming that this is movie rental on physical hard drives,not online movie rent service.
